	<appdesc><![CDATA[Pocket-Locator is a free service that gives you the ability to remotely share & update your location on your website or application. It's not related to any social network and will not share your location with anyone. You do the sharing when you want, how you want and where you want.<br>
<br>
In fact, it's 3-steps simple:<br>
<ul><li>You create an account for free. Takes 2 min</li>
<li>You paste a single line of code wherever you want (in your website, your software, your flash movie, ...)</li>
<li>Via our mobile phone web-application, you submit your location (using the phoneâ€™s gps geolocation or not)</li></ul>
<br>
In real-time and for free your location is displayed everywhere you entered the line of code]]></appdesc>
